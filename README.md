# hello-world
OK - everyone needs a "hello world" program, right?
And now more text is added to this branch of my "hello world". Exciting stuff this is. This project contains a single Jupyter notebook `hello-world.ipynb`. It contains two cells:
- Print "hello world", and
- Print "hello lovely world"

Requirements:
- Python 3.6
- Conda 3 to run Jupyter notebook
